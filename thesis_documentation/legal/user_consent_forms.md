## INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE

You are being invited to participate in a research study examining how mobile notifications can improve access to river flow information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This study is being conducted as part of a Master's thesis research project.

**Please take your time to read this information carefully and ask questions about anything you do not understand.**

## PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

### Research Objectives
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a mobile notification system can make scientific river flow data more accessible and useful for recreational water users. We are investigating how automated alerts about changing water conditions might improve decision-making and safety for activities like fishing, kayaking, and other water recreation.

### Why You Are Being Asked
You are being invited because you are an active recreational water user who uses flow information for planning outdoor activities. Your experience and feedback are valuable for understanding how to make scientific data more accessible.

## WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY

### Study Timeline (Approximately 4 weeks total)
1. **Initial Interview** (20-30 minutes): Discussion about your current information-seeking habits
2. **System Setup** (15-30 minutes): Installing the research app and configuring notifications
3. **Usage Period** (2 weeks): Natural use of the notification system
4. **Final Evaluation** (60-90 minutes): Usability testing, interview, and feedback session

### Detailed Activities

#### Pre-Study Interview
- Discussion about how you currently get river flow information
- Questions about your water activities and planning process
- Audio recording (with your permission) for research analysis
- Demographic questionnaire (age range, experience level, location)

#### System Usage Period
- Install enhanced version of Rivr app with notification features
- Set up personalized flow alerts for rivers you care about
- Use the system naturally for your water activity planning
- Optional: Keep brief notes about decisions influenced by notifications

#### Post-Study Evaluation
- Complete standardized usability questionnaire
- Participate in interview about your experience
- Demonstrate how you configured the notification system
- Provide feedback on system improvements

### Data Collection
During your participation, we will collect:
- **Interview responses** (audio recorded with permission)
- **Survey answers** about usability and satisfaction
- **App usage data** (which features you use, how often)
- **Notification interactions** (which alerts you open, respond to)
- **System configuration** (what thresholds and alerts you set up)

## RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS

### Minimal Risk Research
This study is classified as minimal risk, meaning the risks are no greater than those encountered in daily life or routine procedures.

### Potential Risks
- **Time Commitment**: Approximately 3-4 hours total over 4 weeks
- **Privacy Concerns**: Collection of usage data and personal preferences
- **Technical Issues**: Possible app malfunctions or notification problems
- **Data Dependency**: Risk of relying on research system for important decisions

### Risk Mitigation
- **Privacy Protection**: All data anonymized and securely stored
- **Technical Support**: Research team available for technical assistance
