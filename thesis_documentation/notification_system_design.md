# Notification System Design: Thesis Methodology

## System Overview

This document outlines the design methodology for implementing a real-time notification system that transforms NOAA National Water Model data into accessible, actionable alerts for mobile users.

## Research Methodology

### Design Science Research Approach
This thesis follows a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, focusing on creating and evaluating a technological artifact that solves identified problems in scientific data accessibility.

**DSR Components**:
1. **Problem Identification**: Accessibility gaps in NOAA data
2. **Objectives**: Improve data accessibility through notifications
3. **Design & Development**: Mobile notification system
4. **Demonstration**: Proof-of-concept implementation
5. **Evaluation**: User studies and performance metrics
6. **Communication**: Thesis documentation and defense

## System Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture

[Mobile App - Rivr with Notifications]
```

### Component Design Rationale

#### 1. NOAA API Integration Layer
**Purpose**: Fetch and process real-time flow data

**Design Decisions**:
- Scheduled polling every 30 minutes (thesis scope)
- Error handling for API unavailability
- Data transformation from NOAA format to app-friendly structure

#### 2. Cloud Functions Processing
**Purpose**: Serverless processing and alert generation
**Design Decisions**:
- Firebase Cloud Functions for scalability
- Threshold comparison logic
- Alert priority classification system

#### 3. User Preference Management
**Purpose**: Store custom thresholds and notification settings
**Design Decisions**:
- Firestore collections for real-time sync
- User-specific threshold configurations
- Notification frequency controls

#### 4. Notification Delivery System
**Purpose**: Reliable alert delivery to mobile devices
**Design Decisions**:
- Firebase Cloud Messaging for cross-platform support
- Foreground and background notification handling
- Deep linking to relevant app sections

## Notification Type Classification

### Alert Priority Levels
1. **Demonstration**: Thesis-specific alerts for testing
2. **Safety**: Dangerous flow conditions requiring immediate attention
3. **Activity**: Custom threshold alerts for recreational planning
4. **Information**: General updates and forecasts

### Message Design Principles
- **Clarity**: Plain language instead of technical jargon
- **Context**: Flow levels with activity-relevant interpretation
- **Actionability**: Clear next steps for users
- **Urgency**: Appropriate priority indicators

## User Experience Design

### Notification Content Structure
```
Title: [Alert Type] - [River/Station Name]
Body: [Flow Level] [Units] - [Context/Interpretation]
Action: [Deep link to detailed view]
```

### Customization Options
- **Threshold Settings**: Custom flow levels for alerts
- **Activity Types**: Fishing, kayaking, safety, etc.
- **Frequency Controls**: Real-time, daily summary, weekly
- **Quiet Hours**: Time-based notification filtering

## Data Processing Methodology

### Flow Data Transformation
1. **Raw NOAA Data**: Cubic feet per second (CFS) measurements
2. **Contextual Processing**: Compare against historical ranges
3. **Activity Mapping**: Translate to activity-specific recommendations
4. **Alert Generation**: Create user-friendly notification content

### Threshold Logic
```
IF current_flow >= user_threshold THEN
    IF alert_type == "above" THEN send_notification()
    
IF current_flow <= user_threshold THEN
    IF alert_type == "below" THEN send_notification()
    
IF flow_change >= rapid_change_threshold THEN
    send_safety_alert()
```

## Evaluation Methodology

### Quantitative Metrics
- **System Reliability**: Notification delivery success rate
- **Performance**: Cloud function execution time
- **Accuracy**: Data freshness and correctness
- **User Engagement**: Notification open rates and actions

### Qualitative Assessment
- **Usability Testing**: Task completion rates
- **User Interviews**: Perceived value and usefulness
- **Accessibility Improvement**: Before/after comparison
- **Safety Impact**: User behavior changes

## User Study Design

### Participant Selection
- **Target**: 10-15 recreational water users
- **Criteria**: Active use of flow information for activities
- **Demographics**: Mixed experience levels with technology

### Study Protocol
1. **Pre-study Interview**: Current information-seeking behavior
2. **System Introduction**: Feature demonstration and setup
3. **Usage Period**: 2-week observation with real notifications
4. **Post-study Evaluation**: Usability assessment and feedback
5. **Data Analysis**: Quantitative metrics and qualitative themes

### Measurement Instruments
- **System Usability Scale (SUS)**: Standardized usability measurement
- **Custom Questionnaire**: Notification-specific feedback
- **Usage Analytics**: In-app behavior tracking
- **Interview Guide**: Semi-structured qualitative feedback

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation**: Firebase setup and NOAA API integration
2. **Core Logic**: Notification processing and delivery
3. **User Interface**: Settings and management screens
4. **Testing**: System validation and user studies
5. **Documentation**: Academic writing and presentation

### Quality Assurance
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component validation
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end system verification
- **Performance Testing**: Load and reliability assessment
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Real-world usage validation

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy Protection
- Minimal data collection (only necessary for functionality)
- Transparent privacy policy for study participants
- Secure data handling and storage
- User control over data and notifications

### Safety Responsibility
- Clear disclaimers about data limitations
- Emphasis on official sources for safety-critical decisions
- Fail-safe design for system outages
- Regular accuracy validation

## Expected Outcomes
