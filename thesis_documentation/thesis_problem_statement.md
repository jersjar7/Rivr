# Thesis Problem Statement: Accessibility Gap in NOAA Data

## Problem Overview

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides critical river flow data through their National Water Model, containing valuable information for recreational water users, safety officials, and researchers. However, this data exists in a format and delivery system that presents significant accessibility barriers for end users.

## Current State of NOAA Data Access

### Technical Barriers
- **Complex API Structure**: NOAA's National Water Model data is primarily accessible through technical APIs that require programming knowledge to access and interpret
- **Raw Data Format**: Information is presented in scientific/technical formats (JSON, XML, NetCDF) that are not user-friendly
- **No Real-time Notifications**: Users must actively query the system to get current information
- **Limited Mobile Access**: Data access is primarily designed for desktop/web environments

### User Experience Gaps
- **Passive Information Delivery**: Users cannot set up proactive alerts for conditions they care about
- **Cognitive Load**: Understanding flow data requires interpretation of numerical values without context
- **Time-sensitive Information**: Critical safety information may not reach users when needed
- **Fragmented Experience**: Users must visit multiple systems to get comprehensive river information

## Impact on Target Users

### Recreational Water Users
- **Safety Risks**: Delayed access to dangerous flow conditions
- **Missed Opportunities**: Inability to be notified of optimal conditions for activities
- **Planning Difficulties**: No proactive alerts for trip planning

### Emergency Personnel
- **Response Delays**: Manual monitoring of multiple data sources
- **Information Gaps**: Lack of real-time condition awareness

### General Public
- **Limited Awareness**: Scientific data remains inaccessible to non-technical users
- **Safety Concerns**: Unawareness of changing water conditions

## Research Questions

1. **Primary Research Question**: How can real-time notification systems improve accessibility to NOAA National Water Model data for non-technical users?

2. **Secondary Questions**:
   - What notification delivery methods are most effective for different types of flow data alerts?
   - How do users interact with and respond to automated flow condition notifications?
   - What threshold and customization options provide the most value to users?
   - How does improved data accessibility impact user safety and recreational decision-making?

## Hypothesis

Implementing a mobile notification system that translates NOAA National Water Model data into user-friendly, contextual alerts will significantly improve accessibility to critical river flow information, leading to:
- Increased user engagement with scientific data
- Improved safety outcomes through timely alerts
- Enhanced recreational planning and decision-making
- Demonstrated model for making scientific data more accessible

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- Reliable integration with NOAA National Water Model API
- Real-time notification delivery with >90% success rate
- Seamless integration with existing mobile app infrastructure

### User Experience Success
